# Day 19 Question:

Given an array n integers and an integer key, are there four elements a, b, c, and d in the array such that a + b + c + d = key? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of key.


Given array nums = `[1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]`, and `target = 0`.

A solution set is:
```
[
[-1, 0, 0, 1],
[-2, -1, 1, 2],
[-2, 0, 0, 2]
]
```
