# Day 15 Question

Find the Container with Most Water

### Problem description

Given n non-negative integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ , where each represents a point at coordinate $(i, a_i)$.
$n$ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at $(i, a_i)$ and $(i, 0)$.
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

###### NOTE: The solution should be time complexity of O (n) and space complexity O( 1 )

#### Example
Input: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`

Output: `12`
